# BASTA
Converting BAM to FASTA a BASTA!

# BAM to FASTA not possible?
BAM files can not be directly converted into FASTA files. This project can do that for you. This tool isn't just reads extractor, instead this tool will make consensus sequence for your BAM file. In next step regions of interest can be specified for shorter laser aimed cutting.

# Support
This project is currently expecting data from SeqBox analysis, but can be easily adjusted for any BAM file dataset. Open issue and I will help you with conversion of your BAM file if you get stuck on something.

# How to
Use tools from bam_to_fasta_cons then generate files similar to output from make_filter and finish process with cons_to_fasta. More precise tutorial will be uploaded soon.
